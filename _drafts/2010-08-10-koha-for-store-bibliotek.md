You can publish the numbers, of course. Just don't miss in your PR that
SAN-OP, Nimes & Lyon3 are live (you've the urls), Aix-Marseille will be
in september.

Note : you can also add : Montauban Public Library, live since more than
1 year, 200k items, 25k patrons, hosted by BibLibre ( all others below
are not hosted but on their own server(s) )

We have an hosting platform that can host many more biblios than they do
atm.
