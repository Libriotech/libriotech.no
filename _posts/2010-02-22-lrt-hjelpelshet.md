<p>Bloggposten <a href="http://techessence.info/node/99">Ten Years of Learned Helplessness Coming to an End</a> av lori_ayre er ikke helt ny, men inneholder noen gode poenger:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is all pretty basic stuff. It's ridiculous that libraries are stuck with the systems they've got without options to determine what changes get made or even the access or privileges that would allow them to make the changes for themselves.</p>
<p>Enter Open Source library systems.</p>
<p>This all changes when libraries start building, supporting, and contributing to the development of their own software. Georgia PINES and the Koha libraries proved it could be done. Now, it is time we all got involved.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The point is...do something! This is probably the biggest opportunity we've had to revolutionize how we do business since the advent of the ILS. But now, after ten years of learned helplessness, it is time to take control back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vel talt!</p>
