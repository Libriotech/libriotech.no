<p>Hvilke erfaringer og tanker gjør bibliotekarer seg når de tar i bruk Koha? Caitlin McGurk forteller om sine egne erfaringer med å innføre Koha på <a href="http://cartoonstudies.org/">The Center for Cartoon Studies</a>’ Schulz Library (oppkalt etter Charles Schulz, skaperen av <a href="http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B8ttene">Knøttene</a>), under tittelen <a href="http://thedeskset.org/?p=3351">Librarianship at The Center for Cartoon Studies’ Schulz Library</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the start of my time here (early November), I’ve been working to build a new, more robust and 21st-Century online catalog. We knew that we wanted something Opensource, easy to build and use, with a strong and supportive online community around it for fixing bugs and general help. After tossing around a few options, we decided that the best route for us would be to go with a Koha catalog. Koha offers an easy to download, free, and reliable integrated library system, with worldwide support via their Wiki page, active listserv, and FAQ section. Repairs, updates, and new add-ons are done daily, making Koha one of the most progressive and committed Opensource catalogs out there.</p></blockquote>
