<p>Recently, there has been a fair amount of discussion about RDF/Semantic Web technologies being central to the efforts to replace the MARC family of "standards", including from the US Library of Congress (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/transition/news/framework-051311.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/transition/news/framework-103111.html">here</a>). However, there does not seem to be much experimenting with these technologies in the context of actual ILSes. I aim to do something about that with the "SemantiKoha" project.</p>
<p>The goal of SemantiKoha is to explore how openly available semantic/linked data can be used in the Koha OPAC to enhance the user experience and aid in discovery. The practical work is at a very early proof-of-concept stage, but there is a <a href="http://semantikoha.libriotech.no/">live demo</a> available (see e.g. the page for <a href="http://semantikoha.libriotech.no/cgi-bin/koha/opac-view.pl?uri=http://data.deichman.no/person/darwin_charles">Charles Darwin</a>) and the <a href="https://github.com/MagnusEnger/semantikoha">source code</a> is also available. See especially the <a href="https://github.com/MagnusEnger/semantikoha/blob/master/README.txt">README</a>, which explains how the demo is set up.</p>
<p>This page will function as a blog in which I dump ideas as they pop up, link to new developments etc. <a href="http://libriotech.no/taxonomy/term/11/0/feed">RSS</a></p>
