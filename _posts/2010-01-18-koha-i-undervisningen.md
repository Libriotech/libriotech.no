<p>Er det bare meg, eller høres <a href="http://lists.katipo.co.nz/pipermail/koha/2010-January/022190.html">dette</a> kult ut?</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, I ran an intensive course. Students, without any previous system admininstration experience, installed debian, then rented debian servers (since we can't host the servers at the school) and then installed koha. All 17 students managed to do it. For what it's worth, I am making my <a href="http://openlib.org/home/krichel/courses/lis508p10w/">syllabus</a> available with slide presentations, and the installation documentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noe  tenke på for de norske bibliotekarutdanningene?</p>
