<p>I den nyeste utgaven av Koha sitt internasjonale <a href="http://koha-community.org/koha-community-newsletter-september-2013/#lianza">nyhetsbrev</a> kan vi lese:</p>

<blockquote><p>On 22 October, Liz Rea and Chris Hall of Catalyst IT and David Friggins and Chris Meech of Waitaki District Libraries will present a workshop entitled “From Librarian to Developer in 90 Minutes” at the LIANZA Conference 2013 in Hamilton, New Zealand.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her er en lengre <a href="http://www.lianza.org.nz/sites/lianza.org.nz/files/w4_liz_rea.pdf">beskrivelse</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Software development for libraries should be led by libraries and librarians. It sounds like a no brainer. The software many libraries choose as the most critical piece of software they use day to day, the library system, is often the software we most want to customise and simultaneously the software we have the hardest time customising. There are few channels available to us to influence future development of our software, and even if channels exist, features can be years in the making... or never reach us at all.</p>
<p>This workshop will demonstrate how the Open Source development process is driven by the needs and desires of users, and provide attendees with the opportunity to experience being involved in the development process of a library system. In 90 minutes we will get a Koha up and running in a prepared Koha developer environment, fix or enhance a part of Koha, and submit the change back to the international Koha community for inclusion in the Koha project.</p>
<p>Attendees of this workshop will need to have a reasonable level of comfort with computers.</p>
<p>Audience: Librarians and non-librarians with an interest in becoming more involved with the
future of library software.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jeg håper å kunne arrangere noe lignende, men for bibliotekfolk med litt programmeringsbakgrunn, dersom vi får til et Koha-arrangement i Oslo i desember. (I form av en 1-2 dages hackfest før eller etter selve arrangementet.) Etter hvert kan vi kanskje få til noe a la dette også, for de med mindre erfaring? Ville <em>du</em> meldt deg på?</p>
