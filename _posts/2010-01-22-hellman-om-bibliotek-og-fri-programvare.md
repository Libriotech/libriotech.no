<p><a href="http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/">Eric Hellman</a> har skrevet et <a href="http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/01/ptfs-to-acquire-liblime-and-move-to.html">innlegg om PTFS sitt oppkjøp av LibLime</a> som er interessant nok i seg selv, men det jeg særlig bet meg merke i var dette avsnittet her:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent popularity of open source library management systems is in large part a search for business models that better align the interests of vendor and customer during the support phase. If the support vendor doesn't perform to the library's expectations, the library can hire a new support vendor without ditching their automation system. If a library wants to add a new feature to their system, or integrate it with a system from another vendor, they can hire a developer based on qualifications rather than access to source. The important thing to the library is not so much the access to source or the cost of the license, it's the absence of vendor lock-in.</p></blockquote>
