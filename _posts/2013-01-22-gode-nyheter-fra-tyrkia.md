<p>Utdrag fra en <a href="http://lists.katipo.co.nz/pipermail/koha/2013-January/035344.html">melding</a> på den internasjonale Koha-lista i går:</p>

<blockquote><p>This project initiated by "Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and
Tourism" and "Near East University".
The project itself aims to migrate all the Public Libraries that are
operating under authority of Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
And this makes up to total 1112 branches, with more than 800.000 users
total and approx. 8.000.000 bibliographic records currently.
Also it's anticipated that this movement will bring great attraction from
other libraries located around the country and also from some other
organisations as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yay!</p>
